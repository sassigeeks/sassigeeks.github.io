Recently I stumbled across a blog article and codepen example for responsive tables using just CSS. This is somethign that has bugged me for quite sometime. I spend ages making sure that my websites are fully responsive including images, text videos etc but I've always fallen short when the need to display a table was required.

# Cross browser support

According to the articles author <a href="http://dbushell.com/about">David Bushell</a>, he tried to impliment this back in 2012 but browser support was flakey and the method was very hacky. But after revisiting this 4 years later has come up with the perfect solution as per the codepen example below.
