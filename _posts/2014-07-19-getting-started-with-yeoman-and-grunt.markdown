Today during what felt like the most rushed and pointless Apple Keynote I've ever had the misfortune to sit through Apple claimed that ther were over 30 million 4" iPhone's in use which is why the company felt the need to develop the iPhone SE 4". I'd argue that the people aren't really bothered about a .6" screen jump on the iPhone 6 and 6S and the real reason they are still using the smaller iPhone is because they either don't want to or can't afford to upgrade. I might be wrong, but I predict here and now that the iPhone SE will be a huge flop even more so than the iPhone 5C.

# iPhone SE, unappologetically pointless.

Having spoken to many people who still use the older iPhone 5S or the even older and smaller iPhone 4S all of them said that the reason that they are using these devices is not because they want the smaller screen and form factor but because they are either stuck in a contract and can't afford to buy a new handset outright or are on Pay As You Go and can't afford an unlocked device. It makes me wonder just how many people fall under this situation and whether or not Apple really will be able to shift as many of these iPhone SE's as they think they're going to. 

# Too many options to litte innovation

It seems that with every year that goes by since the world lost Steve Jobs from the helm of Apple that the companies product line is becoming more and more disolved. No longer are they developing a handful of devices and making them the best damn devices the world has ever seen. When Jobs took back the reins in 2007 he slashed the product lines to just a handful of products and made the company profitable and in a very short space of time. With every new unecessary line that Apple adds to it's product lineup (think, iPad Pro 9.7", Apple Watches and Bands, etc) it deteriates the overall quality and innovation of its bread and butter product lines. 

    
# Apple's taken the 'PRO' out of the iPad Pro

When Apple launched the 12" iPad Pro many wondered what exactly was meant to be pro about the device other than it's monsterous size and Apple Stylus, Sorry Pencil. I lost count of the amount of tech blogs that said it was a beautiful iPad but it didn't do a lot to deserve it's Pro moniker. Today Apple has managed to waterdown the Pro appeal of that original iPad Pro by basically taking an iPad Air and adding a few spec bumps and Apple Pencil support. Why they didn't just release an iPad Air 3 which most people were crying out for and just make it compatible with the pencil if they really had to do something but naming this a pro and narrowing the gap between the standard sized iPad and the iPad Pro has surely got to hurt the sales of the original 12" iPad Pro. Not only that it adds to the confusion of the already mentioned over crowded line up of Apple products. But what really has me butt hurt is not getting a new updated iPad Air. To get an upgrade for my iPad Air I'm forced to either take the plunge with either of the Pro models which are much more expensive than the iPad Air 3 would have been.
